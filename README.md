# Checkers

Here we go! Finally we have one of the most promising games... It's a new competitor to the Fortnite and it's Checkers. It's just simple checkers that was programmed on Java using JavaFx framework. Simple as ax, but you shouldn't underestimate that simplicity, otherwise that ax will suprisingly turn up in your ass one day. After you download it you could play SinglePlayer. If you have a friend that will be ready to play that shit you can start server and you could have a joy together. Also we made one screenshot of that awesome game:
